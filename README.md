# cpp_commodity_sales_loop
This Commodity Sales Loop program (C++) allows the user to enter the number of units and sales price for commodity items sold throughout the day. An algorithm finds the lowest and highest transactions from the array of input values, printing a transaction report to the console.

If the user enters the escape numbers -99 0, the loop exits.
